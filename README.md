# The Joke Teller

## Overview
- Calling a joke API to get a joke
- Utilizing the Text-to-speech API to tell us this joke upon the press of a button.
	- https://www.voicerss.org//api/ 
        - Very poor documentation; got it to work after going through the discussions in the RapidAPI page for this API.
- Utilizing a joke API to get a random API, then passing that API into the text-to-speech API.
- Another good project for practicing asynchronous JS. 
- Good project for gaining experience in reading documentation and finding the answer elsewhere when the documentation for a given API is subpar.

## Resources
- RapidAPI
    - This was an awesome find for me. Very cool resource for discovering, comparing and testing APIs.

## Learnings
- Learned how to utilize the Audio element and the Audio object's properties and methods. 
- Learned how to use Axios in the browser


## Potential Improvements
- Add an options dropdown allowing user to change:
    - Voice
    - Speed of voice
    - volume control
